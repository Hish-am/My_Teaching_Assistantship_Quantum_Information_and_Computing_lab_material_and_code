# My_Teaching_Assistantship_Quantum_Information_and_Computing_lab_material_and_code
Quantum info and computing code and problem sets from the Lab session (CIE470) I direct at UST-ZewailCity (Fall 2020-2021)


# Overview:
These are the tutorials and lab material I prepare and teach for the communication and information department's "CIE470"; Fall 2020; 4th year 3-Credit Hour Course titled "introduction to quantum  composed of a 2 hour long weekly lecture given by the course coordinator, subsidised by a 2 hour long weekly lab session which I run personally.

I am the course's sole teaching assistant, and am the sole teacher for the weekly 2 hour lab and coding session, where I teach quantum information and computing coding through Qiskit, in addition to theorical problem solving sets I prepare with the help of many sources including Nielsen and Chuang's Quantum Computation and Quantum Information textbook, Steeb and Hardy's Problems and Solutions in Quantum Computing and Quantum Information, and John Preskill's quantum computation lectures notes.

I will usually upload my descriptive slides and code notebooks seperately, and there will be 2 seperate folders, one for the lab sessions and the other for the problem solving session.
